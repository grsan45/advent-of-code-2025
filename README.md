# Advent of Code 2025

Here's my advent of code repository for 2025.

I plan on doing each day's puzzle in a different language this year. I'll be doing the first puzzles with languages I don't know since they are easier.

When applicable I will include the output of each program in a comment at the bottom of the main function or file.
