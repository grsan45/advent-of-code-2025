# Advent of Code 2025

Here's my advent of code solutions for 2025.

I plan on doing each day's puzzle in a different language this year. I'll be doing the first puzzles with languages I don't know since they are easier.

When applicable I will include the output of each program in a comment at the bottom of the main function or file.

Puzzle List - _Italics_ indicate that I learned that language for the puzzle
- [x] Day 1 -- _Rust_
- [x] Day 2 -- ~~_PDP-11 Assembly_~~ _Vlang_ (See Below)
- [ ] Day 3 -- Lua/_Prolog_ -- Prolog will be done at a later date
- [ ] Day 4 -- Bash / PostgreSQL
- [ ] Day 5 -- _Haskell_
- [ ] Day 6 -- _Zig_
- [ ] Day 7 -- _Dart_
- [ ] Day 8 -- _Go_
- [ ] Day 9 -- Python
- [ ] Day 10 -- C
- [ ] Day 11 -- JS
- [ ] Day 12 -- Java

<sub>While Day 2's puzzle is technically possible with PAL11, it requires 64-bit arithmetic which is not easy to implement on a 16-bit system with a basic assembly language. I also didn't really want to spend all day solving the puzzle with another more modern assembly language.</sub>
